This will be a proof-of-concept GP learning sandbox for me to figure out how the basics of the maths works.

I will aim to produce a script that does the following:
- Create a blank plot that ranges from 0->100 on the x and -1->+1 on the y
- When the user clicks a point on the plot, add a data point there (with some arbitrary error?)
- Fit a Gaussian process to the data on screen
- Plot errorbars on what the best fit about those data are

Optionally:
- Variable errorbars
- Ability to twiddle the priors
